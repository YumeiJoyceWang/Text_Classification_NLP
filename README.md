# NLP Text Classification

In this project we look at several ways of classifying texts:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Regression

We will use two datasets for binary label classification (sentiment analysis) and multinomial classification (topic analysis):
- [IMDb movie review sentiment](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- [AG News topics](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news)
